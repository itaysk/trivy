In order to contribute to the project, we ask that you sign a [Contributor License Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement). This makes sure that the project and the community is free to use your contributions without legal implications.

When submitting a pull request, a CLA Assistant bot will automatically check if you have signed the CLA. If not, it will ask you to sign it. The bot will provide a link to the CLA and a link to sign it. You can review the CLA blurb here: <https://cla-assistant.io/aquasecurity/trivy>.

We also offer a corporate CLA for companies that want to allow their employees to contribute to the project. This is a separate CLA from the individual CLA. If you are interested in it, please contact us at [oss@aquasec.com](mailto:oss@aquasec.com).
